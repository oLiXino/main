== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the FlashSpeed App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 2`.

.Component interactions for `delete 2` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DeckListPanel`, `CardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MasterParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a card).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::editcard[]
=== Shortcut editing of Card face values
==== Current Implementation

The `edit` command allows for the values of a Card's face(s) to be changed. There are 3 command formats
accepted:

* `edit INDEX FRONT:BACK` +
* `edit INDEX :BACK` +
* `edit INDEX FRONT:`

This functionality is implemented by replacing the Card to be edited in the Deck with a new Card containing
the new face values (`FRONT` and `BACK`). The shortcut versions of the command (second and third formats above) allows
for one face value of the Card to be edited while preserving the other face value. In this situation, the unedited face
value in the new Card will be a blank string (since either `FRONT` or `BACK` will be a blank string). Subsequently, this
blank value will be replaced by the associated value in the Card to be replaced.

The validation of the arguments in the `edit` command is performed in `EditCommandParser#parse()`. Note that
the validation only checks that the command is well-formed. It does not check for the validity of the command
in the current environment (e.g. if we are currently in Deck view or not). This is for separation of parsing
logic and model management logic.

In `EditCommandParser#parse()`, the `INDEX` of the card to be edited and the new face value(s) are extracted
from the arguments in the `edit` command. The `INDEX` is converted to an Index object. An `EditCardCommand`
object is then constructed with the Index and the new Card as its parameters.

When `EditCardCommand#execute()` is executed, the environment is then checked. The `edit` command is only valid when
we are currently in a Deck, thus a check on the current view is performed using `ModelManager#getView()`. Then
the Index of the card to be edited is checked by ensuring it is in the range of [0, size of current Deck) using
`ModelManager#getCurrentDeck().getSize()`.

To perform a replacement of a Card in the current Deck, we need the old Card and the new Card. The old Card is required
so we can know which Card is to be replaced via an equality check and also to know the face value which needs to be
preserved (if needed). We can get the Card to be edited using `ModelManager#getCard()` with the provided Index. We can
then perform the replacement using `ModelManager#replaceCard()` with the old Card and the new Card as the parameters.

`ModelManager#replaceCard()` will go through `Deck#replace()` and finally to `UniqueCardList#replace()`.
In `UniqueCardList#replace()`, if the new Card has an empty string as its value in either face, the value is
replaced with the face value of the Card in the current Deck to be replaced. This preserves the old face value
which was expected from using the shortcut formats of the `edit` command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `edit` operation works:

image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the replacement Card is formed during the start of execution

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A blank string in a face of the new Card means we use the face value in the Card to be replaced.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Can use the extracted values in the arguments as is. Let the final step (`UniqueCardList#replace()`) handle the replacement logic.
** Cons: From `EditCardCommandParser` until the end of the command execution in `LogicManager`, there may exist a Card with a face containing a blank string. May not be a desirable object to have.
* **Alternative 2:** Get the Card to be edited directly in `EditCardCommandParser` so we can immediately produce the new Card with its final face values.
** Pros: The Card to replace the old Card will be fully formed from the start.
** Cons: No separation of parsing and model management logic since we would need to do a view check and get a Card from the current Deck all while in the parser.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
