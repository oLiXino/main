// tag::introduction[]
== Introduction
FlashSpeed is a text-based flashcard application specifically designed for university students who are learning a foreign language.

FlashSpeed enhances the revision process by implementing a <<smart-review-system,smarter review system>> in its design. Users will be tested more frequently on words that they have gotten wrong in a game session.

The main features of FlashSpeed allows users to:

* create their own <<deck, decks>> of <<card, cards>> (flashcards)
* choose a deck to <<play, play>> (review) which uses the SRS design mentioned above.

[[Purpose]]

== Design

// tag::design-arch[]

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

FlashSpeed is mainly built on top of a few core components, runner components, and helper components. The core is where
the bulk of the design decisions are made and data processing is performed.

The *_Architecture Diagram_* below gives a high-level overview of the FlashSpeed App.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

Given below is a quick overview of each component.

*The Runners:* +

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com/flashspeed/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com/flashspeed/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At launch: Initializes the core components in the correct sequence, sets up their initial states, and connects them up
with each other.
* At exit: Performs cleanup of components where necessary and shuts down FlashSpeed.

*The Helpers:* +

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following classes plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Writes log messages from many different running components to the FlashSpeed's log file and console.
* `Index` : Provides storage of index numbers and easy conversion between one- and zero-based indices.
* `Messages` : Keeps many user-visible messages for invalid user actions.
* `Exceptions` : Contains different types of specific exceptions which can occur due to invalid user actions.

*The Core:* +

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of FlashSpeed.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data and current state of FlashSpeed in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from and writes data to a data file on the hard disk.

// end::design-arch[]

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== 3.1.1 How the core components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the core components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `remove 2`.

//tag::UI-component[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com/flashspeed/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DeckListPanel`, `CardListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com/flashspeed/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* `HelpWindow` will only be shown when executing `help` command.
* `StatisticsPopUp` will only be shown after finishing or stopping a *Play session*.
* Either `CardListPanel` or `PlayPanel` is displayed depending on the current <<view, view>>.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com/flashspeed/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MasterParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a card).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Structure of the Deck Component within the Model Component
image::ModelClassDeckDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com/flashspeed/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Library's current state and data.
* stores and manipulates a `GameManager` object that represents one game session.
* stores and manipulates a `Deck` object that represents the deck that the user is viewing when user is in <<deck-view, deck view>>.
* stores and manipulates a  `Card` object that represents the card that the user is playing with when user is in <<play, play view>>.
* stores and manipulates `View` object that represents the <<view, view>> that the user is currently in.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Deck>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::../diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png[]


*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/com/flashspeed/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save all the decks and cards created in JSON format and read them back.


// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `com.flashspeed.commons` package.

{empty} +

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

{empty} +

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

{empty} +

// tag::createdeck[]

=== Creating a Deck
==== Current Implementation

The `create` command allows user to create a new Deck in the current Library.

Accepted syntax: `create DECK_NAME`

This functionality is implemented by getting the Deck based on the index provided. Subsequently, the Card(s) that belongs to the selected Deck will be displayed on the right panel via a `TableView`.

===== Validation and extraction of input in parser
The validation of the arguments in the `create` command is performed in `CreateDeckCommandParser#parse()`. It ensures
that the user has entered a non-null deck name.

In `CreateDeckCommandParser#parse()`, the `DECK_NAME` of is extracted
from the arguments in the `create` command. The `DECK_NAME` is converted to a Name object. An `CreateDeckCommand`
object is then constructed with the Deck name as its parameter.

===== Execution of Command object
When `CreateDeckCommand#execute()` is executed, an empty Deck with the Name parsed in the `CreateDeckCommand` will be
created when the Model Manager invokes the `ModelManager#selectDeck()` command.
After that, `ModelManager#setSelectedDeck()` method will be called to update the UI and display the Deck content
on the right panel. Lastly, the name of the selected Deck will be displayed together with the
`MESSAGE_SUCCESS` on the `ResultDisplay` panel.

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of operations due to a `create` command.

.Interactions inside the Model and Logic components when the user enters `create Japanese` into the input box.
image::../diagrams/CreateSequenceDiagram.png[Something]

// tag::create-deck-consideration[]
==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: If the user is already viewing another deck and decides to create a new deck, there was a consideration whether to switch the UI for the user view to the new deck or continue to let the user view the current deck.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Switch the view to the new Deck
** Pros: Able to use the new Deck immediately without typing an additional command to select it.
* **Alternative 2:** Keep the view at the current Deck
** Pros: Don't have to type in an additional command to return back to the current Deck if a new Deck is created

We chose Alternative 1 in the end as we believed that it will be more likely for the user to want to use the new deck immediately after creating it.
// end::create-deck-consideration[]

[[Four-Two-Two]]
===== Aspect: Naming convention of command key words.
Initially, both `CreateDeckCommand` and `AddCardCommand` share the same keyword, which is the `add` keyword.
In order to distinguish these two commands from each other,
the Model Manager will check if any deck is currently selected.
If there is, `AddCardCommandParser#parse()` will be called to parse the arguments.
Otherwise, `CreateDeckCommandParser#parse()` will be called.

The benefit of this design is that it results in fewer number of command words.
This helps the user on the navigability of the application due to a few number of command words to remember.

However, the glaring disadvantage is that unexpected outcomes are more likely to occur.
For example, assume that the user wants to create a new deck. So, he/she types in the following command:

`create Deck 2`

However, the user has forgotten that a deck is currently being selected.
Therefore, the `AddCardCommandParser#parse()` will be invoked.
This is certainly not the expected outcome that the user has expected.

And so, our team has decided to implement the current approach,
which is to assign different keywords to these two different feature.
// end::createdeck[]
{empty} +


//tag::selectdeck[]
=== Selecting a Deck
==== Current Implementation

The `select` command allows user to view the Card content of a Deck.

Accepted syntax: `select INDEX`

This functionality is implemented by getting the Deck based on the index provided. Subsequently, the Card(s) that belongs to the selected Deck will be displayed on the right panel via a `TableView`.

The validation of the arguments in the `select` command is performed in `SelectDeckCommandParser#parse()`. It ensures that the user has entered a valid index (valid data type and range). This is also used for separation of parsing
logic and model management logic.

In `SelectDeckCommandParser#parse()`, the `INDEX` of the selected Deck is extracted
from the arguments in the `select` command. The `INDEX` is converted to an Index object. An `SelectCardCommand`
object is then constructed with the Index as its parameter.

When `SelectDeckCommand#execute()` is executed a list of currently available Deck is requested from the `ModelManager#getFilteredDeckList()` method. The `ModelManager#selectDeck()` command will be invoked to update the variable that keeps track of the current Deck. After that, `ModelManager#setSelectedDeck()` method will be called to update the UI and display the Deck content on the right panel. Lastly, the name of the selected Deck will be displayed together with the `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` on the `ResultDisplay` panel.

==== Design Considerations
The UI will have to be constantly updated when we select to view a deck, and other decks might be selected afterward. As a result, an `ObservableValue<Deck>` variable will have to be updated constantly via the `ModelManager#setSelectedDeck()` method. Various event listeners are implemented in the UI classes (e.g `CardListPanel`, `DeckListPanel`) in order to instantly react if there is any changes to the selected deck.

//end::selectdeck[]
{empty} +


// tag::addcard[]

=== Adding a Card
==== Current Implementation

The `add` command allows user to create a new Card in the current Deck.

Accepted syntax: `add FRONT_VALUE:BACK_VALUE`

This functionality is implemented by getting the Deck based on the current deck selected.
The Model Manager will be responsible of keeping track of the current deck.
Subsequently, the Model Manager creates a new card  adds it to the current Deck.
The display on the right panel will be updated via updating the `TableView`.

===== Validation and extraction of input in parser
The validation of the arguments in the `add` command is performed in `AddCardCommandParser#parse()`. It ensures
that the user has entered a non-null front value as well as a non-null back value.
The lack thereof will cause a `InvalidFaceValueException` to be thrown.

In `AddCardCommandParser#parse()`, the `FRONT_VALUE` and the `BACK_VALUE` are extracted
from the arguments in the `add` command.
Both values will be converted to a `FrontFace` object and a `BackFace` object respectively.
A `AddCardCommand` object is then constructed with the 'FrontFace' and 'BackFace' objects as its parameters.

===== Execution of Command object
When `AddCardCommand#execute()` is called, a `Card` object with the `FrontFace` and `BackFace`
parsed in the `CreateDeckCommand` will be
created when the Model Manager invokes the `ModelManager#addCard()` command.
After that, `ModelManager#setSelectedDeck()` method will be called to update the UI and display the Deck content
on the right panel. Lastly, the name of the selected Deck will be displayed together with the
`MESSAGE_SUCCESS` on the `ResultDisplay` panel.

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of operations due to an `add` command.

.Interactions inside Model and Logic components when user enters `add ありがとう:thanks` into the input box.
image::../diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
See <<Four-Two-Two, 4.2.2 - Design Considerations for creating a Deck - Aspect: Naming convention of command keywords>>.
// end::addcard[]

{empty} +

// tag::editcard[]

=== Editing a Card: Shortcut Formats
==== Current Implementation

The `edit` command allows for the values of a Card's face(s) to be changed.

Accepted syntax:

* `edit INDEX FRONT:BACK`
* `edit INDEX :BACK`
* `edit INDEX FRONT:`

This functionality is implemented by replacing the Card to be edited in the Deck with a new Card containing
the new face values (`FRONT` and `BACK`). The shortcut versions of the command (second and third formats above) allows
for one face value of the Card to be edited while preserving the other face value. In this situation, the unedited face
value in the new Card will be a blank string (since either `FRONT` or `BACK` will be a blank string). Subsequently, this
blank value will be replaced by the associated value in the Card to be replaced.

Below is a summary of the operations flow during the editing of a card.

.Operations flow during an Edit command.
image::EditCardActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Validation and extraction of input in parser
The validation of the arguments in the `edit` command is performed in `EditCommandParser#parse()`. Note that
the validation only checks that the command is well-formed, i.e. understandable by FlashSpeed. It does not check for the validity of the command
in the current environment (e.g. if we are currently in Deck view or not). This is for separation of parsing
logic and model management logic.

In `EditCommandParser#parse()`, the `INDEX` of the card to be edited and the new face value(s) are extracted
from the arguments in the `edit` command. The `INDEX` is converted to an Index object. An `EditCardCommand`
object is then constructed with the Index and the new Card as its parameters.

===== Execution of Command object
When `EditCardCommand#execute()` is executed, the environment is then checked. The `edit` command is only valid when
we are currently in a Deck, thus a check on the current view is performed using `ModelManager#getView()`. Then
the Index of the card to be edited is checked by ensuring it is in the range of [0, size of current Deck) using
`ModelManager#getCurrentDeck().getSize()`.

To perform a replacement of a Card in the current Deck, we need the old Card and the new Card. The old Card is required
so we can know which Card is to be replaced via an equality check and also to know the face value which needs to be
preserved (if needed). We can get the Card to be edited using `ModelManager#getCard()` with the provided Index.
The new Card can then be created.
We can then perform the replacement using `ModelManager#replaceCard()` with the old Card and the new Card as the parameters.

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of operations due to an `edit` command.

.Operations performed for the `edit 1 fr:bk` command.
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the replacement Card is formed during the start of execution

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A blank string in a face of the new Card means we use the face value in the Card to be replaced.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Can use the extracted values in the arguments as is. Let the final step (`UniqueCardList#replace()`) handle the replacement logic.
** Cons: From `EditCardCommandParser` until the end of the command execution in `LogicManager`, there may exist a Card with a face containing a blank string. May not be a desirable object to have.
* **Alternative 2:** Get the Card to be edited directly in `EditCardCommandParser` so we can immediately produce the new Card with its final face values.
** Pros: The Card to replace the old Card will be fully formed from the start.
** Cons: No separation of parsing and model management logic since we would need to do a view check and get a Card from the current Deck all while in the parser.

// end::editcard[]

{empty} +

// tag::play[]
=== Starting a play session
==== Current Implementation

The `play` command creates a new session to play with a specific deck.

Accepted syntax: `play INDEX`

The play command changes the mode of the application to `PLAY` mode and creates a new session with the Deck at the given `INDEX`.
The value of the `FRONT` of the selected `Deck` will be displayed to the user.

===== Validation and extraction of input in parser
The first validation of the `play` command is performed in `PlayCommandParser#parse()`.
The validation only checks that the `play` command has the correct format as the `INDEX` argument is given by the user and it is performed on the login level.

In `PlayCommandParser#parse()`, the `INDEX` of the deck is extracted from the arguments in the `play` command. The `INDEX` is converted to an Index object. An `PlayCommand`
object is then constructed with the Index.


===== Execution of Command object
After the object of the `PlayCommand' is constructed, `PlayCommand#execute()` will be executed and the second validation of the `play` command is performed.
This validation firstly checks if the given `INDEX` argument is a non-negative integer and is within the number of cards in the selected Deck. Then the validation checks if
there is any card currently in the selected deck by checking if the `FRONT` face and `BACK` face of the card returned by `ModelManager#play()` are both empty.

A valid `play` command will change the `MODE` of the `ModelManager` to `PLAY` mode and a `GameManager` object will be constructed in `ModelManager`.
The first card of the selected deck is obtained using `deck#asUnmodifiableObservableList().get(0)` and returned to UI. The `FRONT` face of the first card will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `play` operation works.

{empty} +

// tag::flip[]
=== Flipping a Card
==== Current Implementation

The `flip` command flips a card in the selected deck to view the `BACK` face of the card.

Accepted syntax: `flip`

The `flip` command displays the `BACK` face of the card that the user is currently playing with to the user so that user is able to check if his or her answer is correct.

===== Validation and extraction of input in parser
No user parameter is required, hence a parser is not needed.

===== Execution of Command object
An `FlipCommand` object is constructed and `FlipCommand#execute()` is executed. In `FlipCommand#execute()`, validation for the `flip` command is performed.
The validation will check if `ModelManager` is in `PLAY` mode using `ModelManager#getMode()`. if `ModelManager` is in `PLAY` mode, then the validation will check if the card has been flipped
by checking if the returned `BACK` face of the card is empty since a card can only be flipped once.

After that, `ModelManager#flip()` will be executed. In `ModelManager#flip()`, `GameManager#flip()` will be executed and the `BACK` face of the card is obtained using `GameManager#cards.get(counter).getBackFace()` and returned to `ModelManager`.

A valid `flip` command returns the `BACK` face of the card that the user is currently playing to the UI and displays it to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `flip` operation works.

.Interactions inside Logic and Model components when `flip` is executed
image::FlipSequenceDiagram.png[]

{empty} +

// tag::answer[]
=== Answering in a play session
==== Current Implementation

User answers to the card that he or she is currently playing with using `yes` or `no` command.

Accepted syntax: `yes` or `no`

After flipping the card, users indicates if he or she gets the correct answer by using `yes` and `no` command.

===== Validation and extraction of input in parser
No user parameter is required, hence a parser is not needed.


===== Execution of Command object
An `AnswerYesCommand` or `AnswerNoCommand` object is constructed and `AnswerYesCommand#execute()` or `AnswerNoCommand#execute()` is executed accordingly. Validation for the `yes` and `no` command is performed to check
if if `ModelManager` is in `PLAY` mode using `ModelManager#getMode()`. if `ModelManager` is in `PLAY` mode, then the validation will check if the card has been flipped
using `ModelManager#getGame().isFlipped()` since a card should not have been flipped before user answers to the card.

After that, `ModelManager#answerYes()` or `ModelManager#answerNo()` will be executed accordingly. In `ModelManager#answerYes()` and `ModelManager#answerNo()`, `GameManager#answerYes()` and `GameManager#answerNo()` will be executed accordingly
and the next card is obtained using `GameManager#cards.get(counter)` and returned to `ModelManager`. `ModelManager` will check if `ModelManager` will check if the session has ended as the user have run through every card in the deck by checking
if the returned card is empty.

A valid `yes` or `no` command returns the next card to the UI and the `FRONT` face of the card is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagrams show how the `yes` and `no` operation work.

image::AnswerYesSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Interactions inside Logic and Model components when `no` is executed
image::AnswerNoSequenceDiagram.png[]

// end::play[]

// tag::design-consideration-play[]
==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Using `yes` and `no` instead of the actual answer.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a simple yes or no
** Pros: User can definitively choose if their answer was correct or not. This leads to accurate evaluation and statistics calculation.
** Cons: Not as interactive as if the user were to type in the correct word/sentence itself.
* **Alternative 2:** Typing in the actual answer itself.
** Pros: More interactive to the user.
** Cons: Typos or slightly incomplete (but correct) answers can be typed it by the user.
As the answers typed in mush exactly match the one on the card, it may result in inaccurate evaluation and statistics calculation at the end of the game.
// end::design-consideration-play[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

== Glossary

[[mainstream-os]] Mainstream OS::
Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS.

[[deck]] Deck::
A Deck is a group of Cards.

[[card]] Card::
A Card mimics a physical flashcard. It has two faces. One side for prompting the user and the other side for the content the user wants to memorize.

[[smart-review-system]] Smarter Review System::
The smarter review system is adopted from the well known <<spaced-repetition-system, Space Repetition System>>.
Cards that are answered wrongly in Play Mode will be shown more frequently in this system.

[[spaced-repetition-system]] Space Repetition System::
Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.

//tag::views[]
[[view]] View::
The state or mode which FlashSpeed is in.
There are three different views in FlashSpeed.

* <<library-view, Library View>>
* <<deck-view, Deck View>>
* <<play, Play View>>

[[library-view]] Library View::
When no deck is selected and no cards are shown.

== Effort
*Overview*
FlashSpeed, a flashcard application, is aimed specifically at helping University students with learning a new language.
FlashSpeed is significantly different from Address Book 3 (AB3) although it is based off of it.
In addition to changing existing features in AB3, we needed to add additional features that would complete our flashcard application. For example, the Play feature is a new feature
introduced in FlashSpeed.

*Challenges and Effort*

* *Card and Deck Model* +
AB3 contained a `person` class, which we wanted to refactor into our `card` class since each card contained information that
could be easily refactored from `person`. However, since we wanted it to be possible to have many cards in a deck and many decks in a library,
there was a design consideration of how we should implement `deck`. After much discussion, we decided to implement it as what can
be described as a "layered AB3" implementation, where in AB3, an addressbook contains persons, but now we have a bigger library that
contains multiple addressbooks.

* *Play feature* +
Since this was a brand new feature that was created from scratch,
there were multiple suggestions from different members for
best way to implement it. After much discussion and some compromise from each design, we came out with our final implementation. Additionally, since
it was a new feature, even after we did the initial implementation, there were things that we did not foresee, such as how the UI would
handle the different views depending on the state of the game and the defensive code to implement to prevent bugs.

* *User Interface Design* +
We were brainstorming for a good interface that could support the three views that we had: Library View, Deck View and Play View.
We managed to create about 2-3 mock-ups that everyone thought looked really good.
We then examined the User Experience (UX) advantages
between the mock-ups and decided ultimately that an enhanced AB3 layout was the best for our flashcard purposes.

* *User Interface Implementation* +
As none of the members in our team were experienced with UI design, our initial mock-up and vision of the UI proved too difficult for us to implement within our time frame.
However, Robert (our UI Lead) focused on building and designing the UI while the rest of the team focused on the functional components of FlashSpeed.
Robert would ask us for input based on the experimental UIs that he had designed and improve it based on our suggestions. +

* *Design Considerations* +
For each major enhancement, there were always a few design alternatives to choose from. As each team member felt that their design considerations had merit,
in our first major enhancement meeting, we spent 2 hours deciding on the initial design implementation. After that meeting, our team decided
on a faster way to resolve such cases by spending a maximum of 30 minutes discussing before casting a vote. It worked well for the
future meetings.

*Achievements*

. We managed to create FlashSpeed to what we envisioned it to be with the features we wanted.
. Although we did not manage to implement all the user-stories that we brain-stormed, we implemented all the essential functionality of FlashSpeed plus a few more nice features.
. FlashSpeed can safely support most digitized written languages in the world, due to our stringent parser checks and language support from Java.
. We learnt a lot about important processes and considerations in software development, e.g consistent coding style, version control skills, documentation writing, extensive testing, etc.
